Hi!ðŸ˜„ I'm Xinyi Liu, a second year PH.D. student of [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn) in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn) and a member of [DAIR lab](https://pkudair.github.io), led by professor [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). I received my B.Sc. degree from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cst.hitwh.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai](https://www.hitwh.edu.cn/) in June 2023. I am the main developer of [Hetu-Galvatron](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/Hetu-Galvatron), an open-source automatic distributed system for efficient transformer training. Currently, My research interest lies in deep learning systems, especially in automatic parallelism and MoE training and inference acceleration.
